# Demand_for_Risk
GitHub repository for analyzing how demographic factors affect financial risk preferences. Includes R scripts for data simulation, Python notebooks for analysis, and a detailed research proposal PDF

#### Repository Overview
This GitHub repository hosts R and Python scripts supporting the research detailed in "Estimating the Demand for Risk in Financial Assets: A Welfare and Demographic Analysis." These scripts generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world demographic and financial behaviours and perform data analysis to support econometric modelling as outlined in the research proposal.

#### Files Description

- **Data Generation.R**: This script generates hyper-realistic synthetic data, simulating individual-level demographic and financial behavior that closely reflects real-world statistics. It is used to create a dataset that includes detailed distributions of age, income, education, and other demographics across a typical population.

- **Data analysis.ipynb**: This notebook analyzes some data on the generated synthetic dataset. Activities include calculating risk aversion coefficients and performing preliminary econometric tests. This notebook ensures the generated data maintains realistic distributions and prepares it for complex model estimations.

- **IO_Proposal.pdf**: This file contains the research proposal, which details the theoretical framework, methodological approach, and expected outcomes of the study. This document is pivotal for understanding the innovative approach to integrating demographic data into financial models.

#### About the Paper
The research proposal "Estimating the Demand for Risk in Financial Assets" introduces an approach to financial modelling by incorporating demographic data into risk preferences and investment behaviour assessments. The study employs a structural econometric model that includes demographic characteristics such as age, income, and education, aiming to accurately estimate clients' risk tolerance.

This approach goes beyond traditional financial advising methods by:
- **Enhancing Prediction Accuracy**: Utilizing detailed demographic data to refine predictions of risk preferences, thus enabling more personalized investment advice.
**Incorporating Time Preferences and Risk Aversion**: This study explores how individual-specific factors like time preferences and risk aversion, influenced by demographic characteristics, affect financial decision-making and asset pricing.
- **Improving Financial Welfare**: The study seeks to enhance individual financial welfare and overall market efficiency by better-aligning investment strategies with actual risk preferences.

The methodology involves advanced statistical techniques, including the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), to estimate parameters that define risk aversion and time preferences across different demographic groups. This comprehensive analysis supports the development of more effective financial products and provides insights that could influence future economic policies and financial market regulations.
